# React Github Pages

1. React router dom setup with BrowserRouter component prop basename set to subpath in server like '/prodemics'. Done here using environment variable .env.production and .env.development files which are used with npm run build and npm start respectively.
2. PUBLIC_URL setup for the static files. Done using the env files. '/prodemics' for prod and not included for dev.
3. 404.html for the non full fledged server hack just like Angular.
